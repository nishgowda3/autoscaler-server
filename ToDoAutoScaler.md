## To DO List
### Server
- Repository configuration [Done: Avinash]
- Clone repo [Done: Avinash]
- Ping for new code from the repository [done:Avinash]
- Deploy/Destroy new instance thru API
- Run agent in the deployed instance
- daemon that will decide when to scale up and scal down

**Servers:**
1. Cloning New Repos [Done: Avinash]
2. Ping for new code [Done: Avinash]
3. Decision making daemon

### Agent
- Library to fetch metrics
- send those metrics back to the server
- execute commands such as safely shutdown the server

Ruby by default doesn't support the supervisor model. But it is critical to implement this model
